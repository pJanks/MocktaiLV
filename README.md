- If you continue as a guest you won't be able to select of view favorites.
- If you sign up you will be redirected to the login page and after entering your information you will be able to favorite drinks and view a page of all of your favorited drinks.

### Project Goals and Requirements
- Use the technology youâ€™ve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery of React, Redux, Router, and Asynchronous JavaScript.
- Work within constraints to deliver a unique product for your audience which helps them in some way. Your project must utilize your assigned API and technology, and must be built for your assigned audience.
- Your applications should have the following core functionality:
-- Display the data from the API in a way that applies directly to your audience
-- Ability for users to store/manipulate the data displayed in the application, such as favoriting or adding to a list
